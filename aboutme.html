  <h2>My thoughts about ROBOTS!!!! </h2>
 <h3>We talked alot about robots and their ethics today. How did your idea of robotics change? What makes you nervous about future robotics?</h3>
  <p>Robotics sounds like something fun to playwith like a remote controled car or a drone but there are many series of tasks when it comes to building a robot. My idea on robotics change because I thought that everything that had an BOE was a robot,but as I worked with an actual robot I realized that it is way more than just a BOE. For example, it has to be programed to accomplish a task, there are inputs and outputs to a robot, etc.... Here, many things are needed to make up a robot like: BOE shields, Dreadboards, jumper wires, resistors, LED,Piezo, push buttons, etc. This indicates that a robot is not just about having fun but it also requires many part to create something that is fun. In my honest opinion I am excited to see how the actual robot is build from scratch </p>
